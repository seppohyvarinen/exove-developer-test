# exove-developer-test
Coding test for Exove's summer trainee program (Fullstack Developer path).

The tasks I completed were 1C, 2A and 3A. The repo is divided in three sections which contain
the directories with the code for each assignment.

# 1C

A simple slider application with React. The slider triggers a change in the squares opacity
after user releases the slider. The value is stored in state and is also displayed in the middle
of the square.
